
# CS Final Project: Vehicle Detection with YOLOv8

This project demonstrates vehicle detection using the YOLOv8 framework.  
We trained a custom dataset of vehicles and tested the model on video footage to evaluate detection accuracy.

## 📁 Project Contents
- `best.pt` — trained YOLOv8 weights
- `data.yaml` — dataset configuration file
- `report.pdf` — final written report
- `presentation.pptx` — slides for final presentation
- `runs/` — training logs and prediction results
- `video.mp4` — sample input video used for testing

## 🚀 How to Run
You can reproduce predictions directly from the command line without writing Python scripts:

```bash
yolo predict model="best.pt" source="video.mp4" show=True save=True
model="best.pt" → trained weights

source="video.mp4" → input video file

show=True → display detections live

save=True → save results to runs/detect/

🧠 Training Summary
Framework: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

Model: YOLOv8s

Epochs: 100

Dataset: Custom labeled vehicle dataset

Performance:

Precision: 0.81

Recall: 0.77

mAP@50 (Car class): 0.849

🎥 Results
The trained model successfully detects cars and other vehicles in video frames.
Example detections include 15–27 cars per frame, plus motorcycles, buses, pickups, and trucks.
